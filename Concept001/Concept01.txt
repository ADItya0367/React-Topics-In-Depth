WHY REACT IS SO FAST 
-mainly because of two reasons 
** Library file size 
** React and vue  works on Virtual dom means whenever we use react
then the whole dom (document object model)...react makes a copy of dom and stores it in the RAM(read access memory) thats why it works very fast
current version of react is now 18.0.0
initial release in 2013(0.3.0)
React is developed by facebook employee jordan walke 

PREREQUISITE TO RUN REACT

-create-react-app should be installed (globally)-this is a package(it mainly gives us a ready made code known as boiler plate)(it also gives us webpack babel and eslint that help us in compiling the files for production)
