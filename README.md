<p color="black">  ReactJS is an open-source JavaScript library designed by Facebook for creating rich and engaging web apps fast and efficiently with minimal coding. The core objective of ReactJS is to provide the best possible rendering performance.
<br>
While other technologies such as Angular were available when Facebook developed ReactJS, most developers were forced to do a lot of coding. Developers using other frameworks have the challenge of having to rework most codes even when crafting components that changed frequently.
<br>
Why do many people prefer to use ReactJS?

It allows developers to write their apps within JavaScript. JSX is one of the greatest features that not only make ReactJS easy but fun too.
The Props make it possible to populate components using custom data.
It uses Virtual DOM that makes the app fast. When ReactJS was crafted, the designers rightly predicted that updating old HTML would become extra crucial and expensive  </p>

<h2 align="left"><strong>Installation Guide </strong></h2>
# How to Install - Step by Step Guide
1. Clone using the following repo link
   #### `git clone https://github.com/ADItya0367/React-Topics-In-Depth.git my-first-project`

2. Go to the project folder and run npm install
   #### `cd my-first-project`
   #### `npm install`

3. Now run your app
   #### `npm start`

##### Note - my-first-project - you can change this with your project name.


# Reactjs Installation

Reactjs can be installed by using any of the following ways:

1. npx
2. npm
3. yarn
4. create-react-app

# 1. Using NPX
- it‚Äôs a package runner tool that comes with npm 5.2+
## npx create-react-app my-first-project

# 2. Using NPM
- it is available in npm 6+
## npm init react-app my-first-project

# 3. Using Yarn 
- it is available in Yarn 0.25+
## yarn create react-app my-first-project

After installing reactjs using any of the above method
Go to the your project folder and run your react app

### cd my-first-project
### npm start

Note: my-first-project is the name of your react app/project, you can change it as per your interest/requirement.

# 4. Using create-react-app

Step-1: First, install - Create React App.

For Windows:
## npm install -g create-react-app

For Linux and Mac:
## sudo npm install -g create-react-app

Step-2: Now, create your project.
## create-react-app my-first-project

Step-3: Now, start the your app/project.
//Go to your project folder & start your app.
## cd my-first-project
## npm start




# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can‚Äôt go back!**

If you aren‚Äôt satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you‚Äôre on your own.

You don‚Äôt have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn‚Äôt feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn‚Äôt be useful if you couldn‚Äôt customize it when you are ready for it.
