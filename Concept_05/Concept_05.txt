CONCEPT- 05

In this Concept we will mainly learn about more about functional and class components .
- We already know that there are two ways to create components in react js . 
- components are mainly the HTML tags we can say and they are created by two methods
 **RFC(react functional component)-just type rfc and the structure will be loaded automatically.

 **RCC(React class components ) , we should know that using react class component is deprecated from the market now by facebook only so 99% we will only use the functional components

Now lets create some create functional and class components in react

STEPTS FROM START
-Install node js
-Install npx (npm i -g npx)
-npx  create-react-app project_name
-there are two main folders (we have already seen the folder structure)
  * Src(mainly contains index.js known as logic file) and Public(mainly contains the structure of html file contains index.html file mainly)

- you can write anything inside the app.js (already created file) between the <div>Hello World !!</div>
- Another way to write or using nested components create a file instead see how to do that 

-Create a folder component in the src folder 
- Now create different files..better to call as components now 
-once created go to that component/file and write rfc or either rcc - you know what it means right ??
- on doing so you will get the basic structure of functional or class components 
- you can now change the content inside <div>change content here</div> under return function of the structure 
- now its time to import and export ..earlier we have studied this right ??
- export the file using any two method we have seen earlier 
- import the file into main file here our main file is app.js 
- once imported and exported inject the file name using self closing tag </>
